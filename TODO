* QCD shape systematic: perhaps divide the sideband into two regions (chwalek) (in progress)

* lumi_dep

* produce results plots with fitted symmetric and antisymmetric components (in progress: still need axis labels)
-- axis labels
-- individual antisymmetric components

0th possible source of bias : bugs
2nd possible source of bias : difference in sample composition

(2) Fix the fractions of the model to those observed in MC@NLO: do we get unbiased asymmetry?  1D
(2) Remove all backgrounds (100 % ttbar purity) and try that.

alternatively

(2) Manually remove all but qqbar from POWHEG and MC@NLO and measure
    Manually remove gg from POWHEG and MC@NLO and measure

fit to 1-D distribution in XL with no background, with calibrations
fit to calibration tridiscriminant only, with calibrations

Add to measurement row:
* fit quality metric (chi2)

* qq only
* qq + gg
* fix ttbar fractions
* qq + gg + {bg}
* fixed sample compositions, fitting only for asymmetry
