* QCD shape systematic: perhaps divide the sideband into two regions (chwalek) (in progress)

* lumi_dep

* produce results plots with fitted symmetric and antisymmetric components (in progress: still need axis labels)
-- axis labels
-- individual antisymmetric components

0th possible source of bias : bugs
2nd possible source of bias : difference in sample composition


Does XL distributions of e+jets match that of mu+jets if eta range restricted to 2.1?

New possible strategy:
1. Fit sample comp first.
2. Fit for Ac with fixed composition
3. Systematics move from profileLL to +/- variations on the fixed composition.

Show distributions for 
a) (f_tt - f_tt_true) / sigma_f_tt
b) (A_c - A_c_true ) / sigma_A_c


--------------------------------------------------------

Fit e+jets & mu+jets simultaneously or separately?

(numbers from joint_bias.py (XL_full))
name bias sigma relbias
   rebin_twoStage_calmg 0.17 0.26 0.67
mu_rebin_twoStage_calmg 0.14 0.39 0.36
el_rebin_twoStage_calmg 0.11 0.35 0.32

   rebin_twoStage_calmn -0.20 0.25 -0.79
mu_rebin_twoStage_calmn -0.20 0.38 -0.51
el_rebin_twoStage_calmn -0.15 0.34 -0.45

Bias is less with separate fitting

QCD shape systematic?

How to make the argument that M- is a linear function of alpha, unless we still break it down into gg,qq,qg,q_g?
* Discussing w Regina, still break it down into components just for this argument, but only for POWHEG, not for MC@NLO




* Make visualizations appropriate for two-stage and alt-tt
* Combine fit automatically, after fitting channels separately
* Sample Composition Systematics




Consider 3-jets
